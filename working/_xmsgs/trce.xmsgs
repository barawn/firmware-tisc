<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;TIMEGRP &quot;PCI_GROUP&quot; OFFSET = IN 7 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;pci_clk&quot; &quot;RISING&quot;;&gt; [TISC.pcf(5175)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.

<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3391" delta="old" >Timing constraint <arg fmt="%s" index="1">TIMEGRP &quot;PCI_GROUP&quot; OFFSET = IN 7 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;pci_clk&quot; &quot;RISING&quot;;</arg> does not specify a data valid duration and will not be hold checked. To enable hold checking on this offset constraint please specify a data valid duration using the VALID &lt;duration&gt; option.</msg>
